## 🧱 Design Decisions

### Layout Adherence
- Implemented **8-point spacing system** using Tailwind’s spacing utilities.  
- **Grid-based layout** for lookbooks and product cards.  
- Section widths capped at **max-w-[1200px]** for balanced whitespace on large screens.  

### Tools for Design Accuracy
- Figma used for visual layout, spacing, and alignment consistency.  
- Tailwind config extended with **custom color tokens** and **font scales** to match Figma spec.  

### Creative Departures
- **Content Strategy:** Focus on visual-first browsing—hero imagery and product highlights dominate above the fold.  
- **Brand Positioning:** “Editorial meets eCommerce” — combining magazine aesthetics with shopping functionality.  
- **Breakpoint Design:**  
  - Mobile-first foundation.  
  - Custom breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px for seamless product grid flow.
